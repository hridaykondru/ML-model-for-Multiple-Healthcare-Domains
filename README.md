# ML-model-for-Multiple-Healthcare-Domains
This project focuses on implementing a (untrained) model which performs well (when trained) for three different types of medical imaging reports: X-rays, Endoscopy images, and MRI.

The foundation of this approach lies in the utilization of transfer learning with the VGG-16 architecture, a renowned convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

The pre-trained VGG-16 model, excluding its top classification layers, serves as the base for the model. By freezing the convolutional layers (transfer learning), the learned features from ImageNet are used, promoting efficiency and enabling the model to grasp intricate patterns within medical images. The subsequent addition of new classification layers, including a flatten operation and a dense layer with ReLU activation, tailors the model for specific healthcare applications.

Furthermore, to enhance model training and address potential convergence challenges, early stopping and learning rate reduction strategies are implemented. These strategies, manifested through the Keras callbacks EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau, contribute to a more robust and adaptive training process.
